  // Character Lore
  lore: "One of Hela's servants, she was once bathed in dragon blood and possesses near-immortal defensive abilities. Frigga's adopted daughter, she also lives in [Asar Manor]. She is proud of her inherited heroic bloodline, sometimes to the point of being overly arrogant, but she is actually softhearted and easily hurt, and very kind. She doesn't want to be hurt, so she always adopts a defensive posture, speaking with pride while saying things she doesn't mean. Loki jokingly calls her \"the misunderstood fake heiress.\" She deeply values the members of the manor and would sacrifice herself to protect her family.",
