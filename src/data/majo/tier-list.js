// MAJO tier list: kit-based placements (updated 2026-10-12), grouped by class.
// Placements are editorial, grounded in each witch's full skill data in
// characters.js and cross-checked with community lists (OSLink 2026-08-18,
// GamingPile 2026-08-30, Bilibili + Gamerch 2026-09-16, and the October wave:
// Bilibili tier video 2026-10-08, Gamerch tier list 2026-10-03, DC Inside
// god-tier ladder 2026-10-11). Bellakey is community-checked (CN #1 overall
// claim at 6 stars, KR just below Bazhuli and Yuhong, JP provisional S).
// NEW WITCHES MUST BE ADDED TO MAJO_TIER_PLACEMENTS or they land in C with a
// console warning in dev.

The all-region community core and strongest free DPS in the game. The CN all-character analysis rates her its top grade (shared only with paid Zhijie, "the reason dedicated Guardians lose their jobs") and the KR October god-tier ladder puts her fourth overall behind Bazhuli, Yuhong and Bellakey.',

    tier: 'SS',
    reason: 'New. The first UR Fighter: a teleport Extreme that pulls priority aggro onto herself for 12 seconds while landing 11 hits (about 1200%, awakened about 1370%) and shaving 2% enemy Crit Resist per hit (down to 22%), a 453% crit-boosted Dodge Counter that feeds 10 Extreme charge, and every ally crit adds 5000 more charge on a 3 second cooldown. CN guides call her overall strength the current number one (sustained DPS still below Bazhuli, physical rules PVP) and KR ranks her just under Bazhuli and Yuhong. Caveats: no invulnerability during the long ult, vulnerable to crowd control, and Yun\'s parry shuts down her posture-free Extreme in the arena.',

Her Crit Damage Interference fits every crit DPS. A month of community verdicts agree on A: CN calls the September pair "very decent", JP sees a spirit-version Xinzi that needs 6-star and maxed investment to bloom, and KR likes the damage but notes she overlaps Xinzi.',
  },
  alice: {
    tier: 'A',
    reason: 'Counter DPS that responds to dodges AND blocks, with an Extreme that stacks Dodge Value and removes Class Skill activation restrictions. Self-sufficient but counter-reliant.',

A month of play confirms the hype: CN calls her output efficiency the best in the game (sustained DPS above Bellakey), KR's ladder has her first overall and irreplaceable, JP rates her S but notes evasion units shut her down in PVP and her multipliers lag her charge speed. She is welded to Patra's ult cycle and wants heavy investment.",
