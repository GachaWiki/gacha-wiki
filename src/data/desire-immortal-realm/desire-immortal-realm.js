      'Desire Immortal Realm is set in a xianxia (cultivation / immortal hero) world. The heroines are figures from Chinese history and legend — warriors, poets, spirits, and goddesses — reborn into the Hehuan Sect (合歡宗, "Union Sect"), a cultivation school renowned for dual-cultivation and enchantment arts.',
      'Each character blends her original legend with a reimagined immortal life. Sun Shangxiang, the Three Kingdoms warrior-princess, arrives in the sect and turns its graceful dual-cultivation arts into a fearsome "violent aesthetics" with her bow. Nie Xiaoqian, the tragic ghost from Strange Tales, retains her kindness despite a death-marred past.',
      'Combat plays out as tower-defense: deploy your heroines as defenders along lanes, level them through star tiers, and unlock awakening skills. Characters belong to one of five classes — Shooter, Assassin, Mage, Priest, or Warrior — and progress across 15 star tiers with growing HP and Attack.',
